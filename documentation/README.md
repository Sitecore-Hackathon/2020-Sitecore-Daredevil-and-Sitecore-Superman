# Welcome from Sitecore Daredevil

## Summary

**Category:** Sitecore Hackathon Website

The purpose of this model was to give more functionality to the Sitecore Hackathon page. It has been a while since it has been updated. I chose to add a filter and break down the elements more using Sitecore. So it will be easier to add participants. New and returing.

## Pre-requisites
Sitecore 9.3
There are currently no other dependencies. The code should will work with an install of Sitecore 9.3 without added modules.

## Installation

Provide detailed instructions on how to install the module, and include screenshots where necessary.
1. Install Sitecore 9.3.
2. In the sc.package folder you will find a package called hackathon2020rewritesitecoreitems.
3. Use the Sitecore Installation wizard to install the [package](sc.package/hackathon2020rewritesitecoreitems.zip)
4. Do a full publish to make sure everything gets published.

## Configuration

There is no configuraton required. There is content setup which is typical of Sitecore setup. Information and how to set things will be in the instruction video.

## Usage

Below is an example of the content tree. After you install the package you will see it. You have the option to insert a country, team and then select members. Also you have the option to select members. See screen shot.
